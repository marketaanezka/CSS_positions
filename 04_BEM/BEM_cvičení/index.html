          Skasgaden is perhaps best known for the intricate patterns in the sand
          where a small stream flows into the ocean. One could spend hours
          walking and seeing new patterns/angles the entire time. The rest of
          the beach is a beautiful golden-sand beach that makes for a nice walk.
          There are also some rocky areas on the left-side of the beach that
          make for a nice stroll as well. In addition to being beautiful during
          the day, Skagsanden opens to the north making it a great place to
          watch the Northern Lights during the right time of year.
