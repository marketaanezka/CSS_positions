            Skasgaden is perhaps best known for the intricate patterns in the
            sand where a small stream flows into the ocean. One could spend
            hours walking and seeing new patterns/angles the entire time. The
            rest of the beach is a beautiful golden-sand beach that makes for a
            nice walk. There are also some rocky areas on the left-side of the
            beach that make for a nice stroll as well. In addition to being
            beautiful during the day, Skagsanden opens to the north making it a
            great place to watch the Northern Lights during the right time of
            year.
